      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in
        1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist
        Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably
        Chad Channing, before recruiting Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success
        popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the
        figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular
        following and continues to influence modern rock culture. In the late
        1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene,
        releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent record label Sub
        Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts,
        often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to
        major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream
        success with "Smells Like Teen Spirit", the first single from their
        landmark second album Nevermind (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the
        1990s, Nevermind was certified Diamond by the RIAA and is credited for
        ending the dominance of hair metal.[1] Characterized by their punk
        aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with
        their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global
        popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album
        Incesticide and EP Hormoaning, the band released their highly
        anticipated third studio album, In Utero (1993). The album topped both
        the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana
        disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Various posthumous
        releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow
        Courtney Love. The posthumous live album MTV Unplugged in New York
        (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.
        Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more
        than 75 million records worldwide. During their three years as a
        mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award and
        Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME
        Awards. They achieved five number-one hits on the Billboard Alternative
        Songs chart and four number-one albums on the Billboard 200. In 2004,
        Rolling Stone named Nirvana among the 100 greatest artists of all time.
        They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first
        year of eligibility in 2014.
